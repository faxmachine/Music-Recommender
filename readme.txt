To use my recommender enter any of the account names below and it will find the most similar account and list that account's top 3 songs.
here are the valid account names:

shannon
marcus
kevin
james
issac
hannah
ben

This is really a proof of concept to show that this simple yet robust recommendation system could
be used with a large amount of data. This data could be library accounts, accounts on a online shopping website
or anything with accounts and somthing with a rating in each account

I enchorage you to change attributes of each song in the data file to see how the program rates the accounts.

NOTE: This program must be run via the command line.
